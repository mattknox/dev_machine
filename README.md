This is intended to be a script for setting up a machine exactly as I want, and perhaps eventually also a framework for defining such configs.  It needs to do the following:

- install brew packages, some with potential config
- install brew cask packages
- global install of selected rubygems, npm packages, etc.
- install my dotfiles
- checkout repos I want to work on.
- do configuration of the OS (switch ctrl/caps lock, add coder dvorak, etc.)
